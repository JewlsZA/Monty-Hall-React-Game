# Monty-Hall-React-Game

### In this game I learned how to use React states effectively.

This game is based on the famous Monty Hall probability puzzle problem. Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?
